# Chatting with Data (for Non-Coders and Coders with No Time)
I am a data-driven person. I know many data-driven people (would you like that statement graphed in a chart or analyzed in a table?). But I often find myself with mere minutes to answer a question that would take significant time investment to answer. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if we could just retrieve the raw data, describe the analysis we want, and get an answer or chart without having to dive into esoteric
platforms or code? That, my friends, is the very essence of chatting with data. By connecting a dataset (or preferably multiple related datasets) with a generative AI chat interface, we can ask questions in a natural language format that would be accessible to project managers, business analysts, health data managers, and marketers.
